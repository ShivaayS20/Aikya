# 🌐 CampusVerse — *Coming Soon*
> “Learn smarter. Grow faster. All in one place.”

CampusVerse is an **AI-powered campus platform** designed to make student learning organized, guided, and connected.  
It merges two powerful ideas:

- 🎓 **CampusServe** → The community-driven resource hub for notes, PYQs, labs, and assignments.  
- 🧭 **PathFinder** → The AI roadmap generator that builds personalized learning paths for any domain (Web Dev, AI, UI/UX, etc).  

Built for the **Lumina Hackathon 2025**, CampusVerse aims to become the digital backbone of modern campus learning — **combining AI, collaboration, and simplicity.**

## 🚀 Vision

> Every student wastes time searching for resources and figuring out what to learn next.  
> **CampusVerse fixes that** — by giving direction, structure, and support through AI + peer collaboration.
